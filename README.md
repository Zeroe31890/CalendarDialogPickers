#What is Calendar Dialog Pickers?

This is a simple library meant to bring together Google's new dialog pickers needed with calendars.
Unlike the other two options, using this library is a bit lighter because it doesn't try to
support anything before 4.0. The pickers available from google are currently date, time, and
recurrence. Timezone will be next.

#Warnings

The 2 main warnings are you need the support libraries and no guarantee for localization.
For now this library is just a collection, so I have just brought together Google's work.
Whatever they localized is what I tried including. Things may break due to this. Simply fix it
if you need non english support and make a pull-request.
